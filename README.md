# Hopper Quest

## Overview
"Hopper Quest" is a 2D platformer game developed as part of the "Unity Essentials: One Month to Game Development Proficiency" online training program at Nagorik Technologies Ltd. This workshop, conducted in December 2024 - January 5th, 2025, was an intensive introduction to game development using Unity, C#, and Visual Studio. Through this program, participants gained hands-on experience with game logic, mechanics, and essential Unity components, culminating in the creation of this project.

## Story
In "Hopper Quest," you play as Hopper, a courageous adventurer on a mission, Hopper must navigate treacherous platforms, avoid traps, and collect health. Along the way, Hopper encounters helpful instructions, hidden challenges, and a final stage to restore peace to the land.

## Game Mechanics
### Core Gameplay
- **Platforming:** Players control Hopper as they jump, run, and navigate through increasingly challenging levels. Precision timing and quick reflexes are key to overcoming obstacles.
- **Collectibles:** Ancient hearts are scattered throughout the game. It heals the player
- **Dialogue and Instructions:** Interactive objects provide players with helpful tips and help them progress the narrative through line-by-line text displays.

### Key Features
- **Jump Mechanics:** A responsive jump system allows players to hop freely across platforms.
- **Collision Interaction:** Objects like to heal, obstacles and leasers interact dynamically with the player, triggering animations, sound effects, and gameplay events.
- **Win Condition:** Reaching the final goal triggers a celebration sequence, including credits that scroll upward line-by-line to showcase the development team and contributors.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity:** Core game engine for designing levels, mechanics, and interactions.
- **C#:** Programming language used to script game logic, interactions, and UI functionality.
- **Visual Studio:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code.
- **Unity Animator:** Used to create smooth transitions and animations for the game’s characters and elements.

## Workshop Learnings
Through this project, participants became proficient in:
- Designing interactive 2D environments using Unity’s tools and components.
- Implementing game logic with C#, such as character controls, scoring systems, and win conditions.
- Creating user-friendly UI components for instructions, score displays, and credits.
- Managing game flow and transitions to deliver a polished experience.

## How to Play
1. **Objective:** Guide Hopper to the end of each level by collecting coins and avoiding hazards.
2. **Controls:** Use the keyboard or controller to move and jump.
3. **Progress:** Follow the on-screen instructions and uncover the mystery to reach the winning point.
4. **Winning:** Complete all levels to view the credits and finish the game.

## Credits
